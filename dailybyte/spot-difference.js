/**This question is asked by Google. You are given two strings, s and t which only consist of lowercase letters. t is generated by shuffling the letters in s as well as potentially adding an additional random character. Return the letter that was randomly added to t if it exists, otherwise, return ’  ‘.
Note: You may assume that at most one additional character can be added to t.

Ex: Given the following strings...

s = "foobar", t = "barfoot", return 't'
s = "ide", t = "idea", return 'a'
s = "coding", t "ingcod", return ''**/

var spotTheDifference = function (s, t) {
  let map = new Map();
  for (const char of t) {
    map.has(char) ? map.set(char, map.get(char) + 1) : map.set(char, 1);
  }
  for (const char of s) {
    map.set(char, map.get(char) - 1);
  }

  for (let [key, value] of map) {
    if(value === 1){
        return key;
    }
  }

  return '';
};
s = "coding", t = "ingcod"

console.log(spotTheDifference(s,t));
